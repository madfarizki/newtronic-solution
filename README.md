This project is a test project created by Ahmad Alfarizki for job application purposes.

### Demo https://newtronic.madfariz.my.id

However, when hosting this project, I encountered an issue where I couldn't fetch data from the API http://103.183.75.112 because the API uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, which is not allowed.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
